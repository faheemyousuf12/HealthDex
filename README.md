Description: This is a Healthdex Frontend React Challenge For React Application. The goal is to filter or search your favourite pokemon, 
you can type into searchbar and filter it also you can filter by type as well.
This has been created on React with Redux as a store. There are reducers, Actions, dumb components and functional components. 
The focus is to consume the poke api and get all the pokemons. I did not focus on styling the interface, it's simple css as 
the focus is on working with react
and redux and consuming API.
